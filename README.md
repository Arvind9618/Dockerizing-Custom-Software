# Dockerizing-Custom-Software
Dockerfile Creation: Wrote a Dockerfile to containerize an Apache 
web server on an Ubuntu base image, ensuring all necessary 
configurations and dependencies were included.

▪ Code Integration: Incorporated the application code into the custom 
Docker image using COPY commands in the Dockerfile.

▪ Docker Hub: Built and pushed the Docker image to Docker Hub for 
ease of deployment and sharing.
